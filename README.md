# Crowd - Gaming

The present final year project considers the design and the development of a
complete application that provides a solution to online competitions/games the
content of which is sensitive to the geographical location of the contestant/player.
The application incorporates a flexible and easy to use content creation center for
the priviledged user(s) to manage their competitions/games. The latter are of a
“treasure hunt” type and they can easily be configured to enjoy wider applicability.
For example, a competinio/game can easilty be used to implement an educational
multiple choice type questionnaire whereby questions are posed in different
languages, according to the geographical location the user/student is currently at.
Another possibility is for group of questions to be set to become visible to
participants only when the latter access the application from a pre-specified
geohraphical region. When the competition/game is over, the scores of the users
who have participated are processed and a detailed report is generated. The
application consists of a relational database server, a web service and three types
of clients (web, iOS, and Android).
